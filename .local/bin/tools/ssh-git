# Adding the ssh key to the ssh-agent:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# In the user settings sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.
